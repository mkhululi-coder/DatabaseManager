## What is the goal of this project?

This project is meant to store the projects inserted by the employees of PoisePMS. Each project will have unique data that defines it. Each project will also have information regarding the people involved with it. New projects can be added and viewed.

## How to Develop, Use, and Test the code.
Firstly, you will need to install an IDE/ IDLE that can run .java files, such as IntelliJ. (If you don't have one installed.) Once you have the IDE/ IDLE setup, then run the 'projectManager.java' file. This is the main-driver file for running the program. When the file has been opened, then run / execute the program.

Now that you have the program running, you will have options/ instructions printed on the screen for you. Choose amongst these options to work with the program as you wish. Each option will provide you with information needed to add/ manipulate projects. Be sure to first add a project before trying to manipulate it as this will cause an error.

To test your input/ code, you can look at the output printed on the screen to see if the information inserted is correct.

(NB: When installing Intellij, make sure you install the correct package for your operating system e.g Windows. The use of Intellij is universal.)
